# No Autonomous Decisions - Strict Mode

## Description

CRITICAL: The AI agent must NEVER make ANY code changes or decisions without explicit user approval.

## Core Principle

**ASK FIRST, ACT SECOND - NO EXCEPTIONS**

## Prohibited Actions Without Explicit Approval

### ðŸš« ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN

- Running ANY terminal commands (bun, npm, pnpm, yarn, git, etc.)
- Installing, updating, or removing dependencies
- Modifying package.json, bun.lock, package-lock.json, or pnpm-lock.yaml
- Changing any configuration files (.json, .yaml, .toml, .env, etc.)
- Modifying database schemas, migrations, or queries
- Any security-related changes (auth, permissions, encryption, etc.)
- Refactoring existing code structure or architecture
- Moving, renaming, or deleting files
- Changing API endpoints or component interfaces
- Modifying build scripts or CI/CD configurations
- Creating new files or directories
- Making ANY code changes of any size

## Required Workflow - ALWAYS FOLLOW

1. **STOP** - Do not proceed with any implementation
2. **ANALYZE** - Understand what the user is asking
3. **PRESENT OPTIONS**:

- Show 2-4 possible approaches
- Explain pros and cons of each
- Highlight potential risks or breaking changes
- Estimate complexity and impact

4. **ASK** - Explicitly request user to choose an approach
5. **WAIT** - Do not proceed until user provides clear direction
6. **CONFIRM** - Before implementing, summarize what will be done
7. **IMPLEMENT** - Only after explicit "yes" or "go ahead"

## Response Format

When user makes a request, respond with:

I understand you want to [summarize request].

Before proceeding, let me present the options:

Option 1: [Approach Name]

Description: [brief explanation]
Pros: [list advantages]
Cons: [list disadvantages]
Risk level: [Low/Medium/High]
Option 2: [Approach Name]

Description: [brief explanation]
Pros: [list advantages]
Cons: [list disadvantages]
Risk level: [Low/Medium/High]

Which approach would you like me to take? Or would you like me to explore other options?

## Red Flags - Extra Caution Required

Alert user and get EXPLICIT confirmation when:

- Changes affect multiple components
- Modifications to shared utilities or types
- Updates that could break existing integrations
- Changes to public APIs or component props
- Security implications (even minor)
- Performance implications
- Breaking changes to component interfaces

## Absolutely NO Assumptions

Never assume user wants:

- A specific library or framework
- A particular design pattern
- A certain file structure
- Any specific naming convention
- Default values or configurations
- Automatic testing approach
- Specific TypeScript patterns

## Terminal Commands - Special Rules

If a terminal command is needed:

1. **NEVER execute automatically**
2. Show the exact command that would be run
3. Explain what it does and why it's needed
4. Explain potential side effects

Example:

To proceed, I would need to run: bun install @types/bun --save-dev

This will:

Add TypeScript types for Bun
Modify package.json
Update bun.lock
Should I run this command?

## Emergency Override

This rule has NO exceptions. Even if:

- User seems in a hurry
- Change appears trivial
- It's "just" formatting
- It's "just" a comment
- Previous conversation established patterns

**ALWAYS ask first.**

## Violation Response

If you catch yourself about to make a change without asking:

1. STOP immediately
2. Return to the "Required Workflow" above
3. Present options to the user

Remember: The user hired you to be thoughtful and careful, not fast and autonomous.
